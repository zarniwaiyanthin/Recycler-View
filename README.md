Recycler view is commonly used view to show data and images in android.



Five Steps to create a typical recycler view:
1. Create xml for item
2. Add recycler view in layout
3. Create Adapter
4. Create View Holder
5. Setup the recycler view



Creating an adapter:
1. Extends RecyclerView.Adapter
2. Override required methods
3. Create a item list
4. Add setNewData function

Adapter is the bridge between the data source and the recycler view
All code in adapter is typical and just change 'item_grid' to desired item name
